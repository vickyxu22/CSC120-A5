- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Using a Venn diagram, it's easy for me to understand "Association." It makes more sense when we separate different parts into different files, work on them separately, and then combine all parts together at the end. Everything worked after debugging. I hope to include more programming examples in the class.
